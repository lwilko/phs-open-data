## What is this document?
This is an R Markdown document. It serves as a notebook for
exploring the [Health Boards (2019) Population Estimates](https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/population-estimates/resource/27a72cc8-d6d8-430c-8b4f-3109a9ceadb1) dataset from [Public Health Scotland](https://publichealthscotland.scot).

## Data used
The dataset used for this analysis is the [Health Boards (2019) Population Estimates](https://www.opendata.nhs.scot/dataset/population-estimates/resource/27a72cc8-d6d8-430c-8b4f-3109a9ceadb1) dataset from [Public Health Scotland](https://publichealthscotland.scot). This dataset contains estimates of the population sizes of each health board in Scotland, based on [2019 census data](https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/files//statistics/rgar/2019/Pages/pop-sec.html) from [National Records of Scotland](https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk).

## Population estimates

```{r wrangle-2021, echo=TRUE}
# Wrangle data to plot health board (HB) populations in 2021
pop_data_2021 <- pop_data %>% 
  filter(Year == 2021,
         HB_name != "Scotland") %>% # get 2021 data (excluding all-Scotland)
  mutate(Population_mils = Population/1000000) # store population in millions
```

```{r plot-2021, echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
# Plot bar chart showing population sizes of health boards
ggplot(data = pop_data_2021, mapping = aes(x = HB_name, y = Population_mils)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  geom_text(aes(label = prettyNum(Population,big.mark=",",scientific=FALSE), vjust = -0.35), size = 2) +
